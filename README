I'm a new graduate student in the MGIS program. I plan to focus my research on climate change and ecosystem health using remote sensing and other tools. I'd like to find a solid balance between gaining versatile technical skills in geospatial data science and specializing in an area I'll find motivating. I have a background in operational IT support and administration at non-profits and schools. I In my free time, I like to garden and ride my bike around. I also play drums in a band.
